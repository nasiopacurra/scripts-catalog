Git basics - a general workflow
https://gist.github.com/blackfalcon/8428401

Using Git and Bash is like using a zipper and pants. They just go together. Creating a Bash alias is extremely simple. From your Terminal, enter

$ open ~/.bash_profile
This will open a hidden file in a default text editor. If you have a shortcut command for opening in an editor like Sublime Text, use that to open the file. 
In the file add the following:

alias refresh="git checkout master && dskil && git pull && git fetch -p"
The alias dskil is useful for removing annoying .DS_Store files. You should have a .gitignore file that keeps these out of version control, but I like to keep a clean house too. 
To make that work, add the following:

alias dskil="find . -name '*.DS_Store' -type f -delete"
With this in your .bash_profile, you simply need to enter refresh in the command line and POW!
